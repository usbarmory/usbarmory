          The NXP Data Co-Processor (DCP) is a built-in hardware module for specific NXP
          SoCs that implements a dedicated AES cryptographic engine for
          encryption/decryption operations.

          This driver is a customized version of the mainline Linux kernel
          driver, patched to allow use of the OTPMK released by the SNVS.
