USB armory Mk II debug accessory
================================

The USB armory is an open source hardware design, implementing a flash drive
sized computer.

The USB armory Mk II exposes a USB Type-C receptacle, which allows through the
so called USB-C 'debug accessory mode' to route analog/debug signals over its
connector, the USB armory Mk II design leverages on this to break out UART,
SPI, I²C, CAN (pre-transceiver), GPIOs connections to/from its application
processor.

The debug accessory board allows to access UART and GPIO signals through USB,
without requiring probes, through an FTDI FT4232H. This allows, for example,
access to the USB armory Mk II serial console without wires or probes, natively
using only USB cables. All other interfaces can be accessed through dedicated
breakout through holes.

This repository is aimed towards developers, if you wish to purchase a USB
armory board please see the [USB armory documentation](https://github.com/usbarmory/usbarmory/wiki).

USB armory Mk II debug I/Os
===========================

*NOTE*: the connection between the debug accessory and the target is supported
only with the same orientation for both top layers (side with components for
the accessory, side with LEDs for the USB armory).

The following table summarizes the available configurations on the USB armory
Mk II through debug accessory mode, which are exposed on its Type-C receptacle
port.

|  USB-C pin   | MUX mode ALT0 | MUX mode ALT8 | MUX mode ALT2 | MUX mode ALT5 |
|:-------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| SSTXp1 (A2)  | UART2_TX      | ECSPI3_SSO¹   | I2C4_SCL¹     | GPIO1_IO20    |
| SSTXn1 (A3)  | UART2_RX      | ECSPI3_SCLK¹  | I2C4_SDA¹     | GPIO1_IO21    |
| SSRXp1 (B11) | UART2_RTS_B   | ECSPI3_MISO¹  | FLEXCAN2_RX¹  | GPIO1_IO23    |
| SSRXn1 (B10) | UART2_CTS_B   | ECSPI3_MOSI¹  | FLEXCAN2_TX¹  | GPIO1_IO22    |
| SSRXp2 (A11) | UART4_TX      | ECSPI2_SCLK   | I2C1_SCL      | GPIO1_IO28    |
| SSTXn2 (B3)  | UART4_RX      | ECSPI2_SSO    | I2C1_SDA      | GPIO1_IO29    |
| SSRXn2 (A10) | UART5_TX~     | ECSPI2_MOSI   | I2C2_SCL      | GPIO1_IO30    |
| SSTXp2 (B2)  | UART5_RX~     | ECSPI2_MISO   | I2C2_SDA      | GPIO1_IO31    |

¹ Only on USB armory Mk II boards mounting i.MX6UL SoC, not available on
  versions mounting the i.MX6ULZ.

Serial console
--------------

When running the [USB armory Debian base image](https://github.com/usbarmory/usbarmory-debian-base_image/releases)
the serial console (UART2) can be accessed, with the debug accessory jumper set to UART
position, as follows (example on Linux host with picocom):

```
picocom -b 115200 -eb /dev/ttyUSB2 --imap lfcrlf
```

Debug accessory jumper settings
===============================

Power source
------------

The debug accessory always acts as a power source and is meant to be connected
exclusively to the USB armory Mk II Type-C receptacle port. The USB armory Mk
II Type-C can be safely plugged on a different receptacle as the board can
handle two power sources simultaneously.

It is not recommended to connect the debug accessory to anything other than the
USB armory Mk II, however in case this happens compliant Type-C receptacles
should handle the situation gracefully¹ without concerns.

¹ USB Type-C Cable and Connector Specification (1.3, 2017-07-14):
  "Legacy hosts/chargers that by default source VBUS when connected using any
  legacy USB connector (Standard-A, Micro-B, etc.) to USB Type-C cable or adapter
  are exempted from these two requirements."

I/O mode
--------

The GPIO and UART functions can be used directly using the FTDI FT4232H USB
interface accessible on the Micro USB Type-B connector, all other modes can be
accessed using the exposed breakout through holes.

The following table illustrates the required jumper positions and interfaces
for each available I/O mode.

| Mode  | GPIO¹ | Interface
|:------|-------|-----------------------------------|
| GPIO  |  GPIO | FTDI MPSSE mode on [A,B]DBUS[4-7] |
| UART2 | !GPIO | FTDI RS232 mode on CDBUS[0-3]     |
| UART4 | !GPIO | FTDI RS232 mode on BDBUS[0-1]     |
| UART5 | !GPIO | FTDI RS232 mode on ADBUS[0-1]     |
| SPI2  |  N/A² | through holes: A11, B3, A10, B2   |
| SPI3  |  N/A² | through holes: A2,  A3, B11, B10  |
| I2C1  |  N/A² | through holes: A11, B3            |
| I2C2  |  N/A² | through holes: A10, B2            |
| I2C4  |  N/A² | through holes: A2,  A3            |
| CAN2  |  N/A² | through holes: B11, B10           |

¹ The GPIO header position refers to termination either of the two pins facing
  the "GPIO" label (GPIO position, pins towards positions 3 and 2) or the
  opposite position (!GPIO position, pins towards positions 2 and 1).

² Any position can be used as the FTDI is not used in such mode.
