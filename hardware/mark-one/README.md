Introduction
============

The USB armory is an open source hardware design, implementing a flash drive
sized computer.

This repository is aimed towards developers, if you wish to purchase a USB
armory board please see the [ordering information](https://github.com/usbarmory/usbarmory/wiki/Ordering-information).

Regulatory compliance & handling
================================

The USB armory board is intended for use as a development platform for hardware
or software. The board is an open system design, which does not include a
shielded enclosure. This may cause interference to other electrical or
electronic devices in close proximity. In a domestic environment, this product
may cause radio interference in which case the user may be required to take
adequate measures. In addition, this board should not be used near any medical
equipment or RF devices.

The board is sensitive to ESD. Hold the board only by its edges. After removing
the board from its box, place it on a grounded, static-free surface.

The board can become hot, like any fan-less design, during continuous high CPU
loads, mind its temperature while handling it.
